 ## Description

Microdosinng is a controversial practice that involves regular consumption of very small amounts of psychoactive drugs. So small that there are no perceivable effects to the user. However, people that have microdosed have reported positive longterm changes in their mental health. Such as the improvement of chronic anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. When it comes to mental and physical health, we feel that it is important to keep track of one's progress as to log the data for later examniation to determine the pros and/or cons of the activity. With Dose, persons that want to try microdosing in effort to improve their focus or mental health. Dose users can add multiple consumables, and log the data that corresponds with that consumable to reflect on. This data will include the frequency of the dosage and the users experince with that certain consumable.
